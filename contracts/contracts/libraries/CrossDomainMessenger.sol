 * @notice CrossDomainMessenger is a base contract that provides the core logic for the L1 and L2
 *         cross-chain messenger contracts. It's designed to be a universal interface that only
 *         needs to be extended slightly to provide low-level message passing functionality on each
 *         chain it's deployed on. Currently only designed for message passing between two paired
 *         chains and does not support one-to-many interactions.
